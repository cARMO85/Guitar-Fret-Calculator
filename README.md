# Guitar Fret Calculator

Welcome to the Guitar Fret Calculator repository. This project is a culmination of my passion for both crafting custom guitars and software development. By blending these two arts, I've developed a tool that aids in the intricate task of guitar fret placement, ensuring precision and harmony.

## Introduction

Building a guitar requires not just craftsmanship but also precise mathematics, especially when it comes to fret placement. The Guitar Fret Calculator is a tool built using Flask to assist in calculating the exact positions of frets on the guitar neck, ensuring accurate intonation and playability.

## Live Demo

Check out the live application hosted on Heroku: [Guitar Fret Calculator](https://new-fret-calculator-1ef44f4849f5.herokuapp.com/)

## Features

- **Fret Calculation**: Input the scale length and get the precise fret positions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design ensures ease of use.
- **Mobile Responsive**: Use the tool on-the-go, whether you're in your workshop or sourcing materials.

## Motivation

As a custom guitar builder, I often found the need to double-check my fret placements. This tool serves to simplify that process, providing a quick and accurate reference. Additionally, this project gave me an opportunity to practice Flask development, merging my love for guitar crafting with software development.

## Setup & Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local system.
2. Navigate to the project directory and install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Flask app using `python fret_calculator.py`.

Now, you can access the Guitar Fret Calculator on your local server and start calculating fret positions!
